aarchup-1.6 (22/06/2011)
    * wont notify about new updates when "pacman -Sy" fail, probably you don't have internet connection.
      You can change this behavior with --ignore-disconnect. Forcing the check for updates ever after "pacman -Sy" fail.
    * better arguments parsing with getopt(GNU)
    * you can now optionaly use /etc/aarchup.conf instead of passing a bunch of arguments to the command-line.
      Check manpages for details.
